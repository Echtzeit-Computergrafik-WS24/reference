/// Define the Glance4 API

/// There is a lot of code in the glance module already and it is a hard task to
/// update all of it at once. Especially since parts of the code are still in
/// use - if not by current then at least by older lectures.
/// So we will start by defining the Glance4 API and then we will update the
/// existing code at the end of the semester.
